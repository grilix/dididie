# Did I die today?

This system is depressing and you feel like dying everyday, but you
have so much to worry about that you can't remember if you already died.

Stop wasting time and energy right now! Here's the tool you needed:

- It remembers that you died, you forget about it!
- Die as someone else to keep it rolling!
- Use the API to make it even easier!
- Integrate it on your own scripts or complex flows!
- Free your mind!
- Break the chains!

## Running it

Something like `go mod tidy` should get you going.

Then, start `go run cmd/server/main.go` and `go run cmd/web/main.go`.
